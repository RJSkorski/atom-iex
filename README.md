# iex package

This package provides Elixir developers with the ability to run an Elixir IEx (REPL) session in an Atom window.

This package is based on the [Term2 Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/term2) with customizations specific to IEx, including key bindings to execute code and tests in the REPL.
